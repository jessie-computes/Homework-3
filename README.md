# Homework-3

This is an application that generates a random password based on user selected criteria. 

The user is prompted for an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, a number between 0-9, and 
a special character to include in the password. The user is also prompted for a desired length, 
between 8 and 128 characters. 

A password is then constructed using the user inputs, and random numbers.
